### A fun little web app that tells your weight in diffrent planet if you were ever curious about that

- Uses simple gravitational laws to calculate weight on diffrent planets
- Formula: `weight on any planet = ((your weight on earth/earth gravitaional pull)* that planets gravitaional pull)`
- Example on moon `weight on moon =((67/9.8)*1.62) = 10.24`

## WIP 🛠
- Better UI maybe?😬
- Mobile APP
- Adding more planets /draf planets /stars /moon's  🤔
